# Current state

Updated: 2026-09-09 UTC

## Established

- `/workspace/capstone` initially contained only `prompt.txt` and a notebook
  checkpoint copy; it was not a Git repository.
- GitHub repository `pokerme7777/HiTSKT` exists with default branch `main`.
- The upstream continuation point is now checked out locally on branch `work`,
  tracking `origin/main`.
- Upstream contains HiTSKT and baseline files for DKT, DKVMN, and SAKT. It does
  not contain an RKT implementation in the inspected tree.
- Upstream dataset CSV paths are Git LFS pointer files locally, not usable data.
- Available compute observed during inspection: an NVIDIA H100 MIG 3g.40gb
  device with about 40 GiB visible to PyTorch, approximately 2 TiB system RAM,
  and 224 logical CPUs. PyTorch 2.4.0a0 reports CUDA 12.5 and successfully sees
  the GPU.

Evidence: repository paths `../README.md`, `../model_layers.py`,
`../Other_models/`, and the 2026-09-09 Git/host inspection recorded in the
active task transcript.

## Assessment conclusion

The inspection is complete. See
[ASSESSMENT_2026-09-09.md](ASSESSMENT_2026-09-09.md). The user has approved the
dataset identity/selection, tag mapping, session/split protocol, rolling-history
evaluation, Performer consolidation, and RKT sourcing decisions. Implementation
is authorized and is beginning with authoritative EdNet-KT1 acquisition.

## Not yet validated or completed

- No ambiguous dataset schema/version has been accepted.
- No preprocessing/tensor/forward/backward/checkpoint/metrics smoke test ran.
- No model/dataset experiment ran; there are no valid benchmark results.
- No changes to tracked project source have been made.
- No commit or push has been performed.

## Known implementation risks requiring evidence

- The supplied Drive “EdNet” data is Riiid and cannot be used; genuine full
  EdNet-KT1 must be acquired and provenance-verified.
- Existing baseline scripts are dataset-hardcoded and do not provide the full
  common evaluation contract.
- RKT is missing locally; an authors' reference implementation must be located
  or its absence documented before a reproduction is written.

Local-only inspection material is under `../.inspection/`; it is untracked and
contains downloaded dataset copies and source variants. It is evidence staging,
not a deliverable or accepted data layout.
